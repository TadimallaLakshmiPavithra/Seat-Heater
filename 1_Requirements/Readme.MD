## INTRODUCTION
* The Seat Heating Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In Some countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that this equipment should work efficiently in that weather. In our project, the sensor will sense that the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature sensor can sense the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display is connected to the Heater to display the Temperature of the seat.

## FEATURES
* The System will sense that driver or any person seated or not.
* Then the Temperature sensor can sense the Temperature of the particular seat.
* As per Temperature, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
* It is best for some Countries where the temperature is low.
* Low cost system.

## SWOT Analysis
## Strengths
* Low cost and Robust System
* Control the temperature inside the vehicle
* Eco-friendly
* Modular approch
## Weakness
* It is only applicable for low temperature countries
## Opportunites
* It can be implemented in the vehicle with respect to the temperature like Heater and Air conditioners
## Threats
* It cannot be used for High or Medium Temperatures
